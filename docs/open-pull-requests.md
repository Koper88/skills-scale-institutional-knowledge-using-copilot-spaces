## Pull Request #3: Add README for OctoAcme project management documentation

**Author:** Copilot

**Link:** https://github.com/Koper88/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/pull/3

**Description:**

Created centralized entry point for OctoAcme's project management documentation. The docs/ folder lacked a navigation index and process overview, making onboarding and discovery difficult.

**Changes:**
- **Created `docs/README.md`** with three sections:
  - **Philosophy & Core Phases**: Customer-first iterative approach with 5-phase lifecycle (Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective)
  - **Process Overview**: 4-paragraph summary covering end-to-end workflow, roles (PM/PdM/Dev/QA), communication cadence, risk management, and quality practices
  - **Documentation Index**: Links to all 8 process guides with descriptive context

All existing documentation files remain unchanged. Links verified against actual filenames in docs/ directory.
