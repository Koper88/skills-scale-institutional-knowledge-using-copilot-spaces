# OctoAcme Project Management Docs: Overview & Index

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation set. This README provides a summary of our project management philosophy, a comprehensive overview of our processes, and links to detailed process guides for each project phase.

## Project Management Philosophy

OctoAcme delivers value through customer-first, iterative, and data-driven approaches. Our project management framework is built on key tenets including clear ownership, measurable outcomes, repeatable workflows, and psychological safety, with an emphasis on continuous learning and improvement.

**Core Project Phases:**
1. **Initiation**: Validate need, define goals, align stakeholders
2. **Planning**: Break down work, create backlog, set milestones
3. **Execution**: Track progress, manage risks, iterate towards goals
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, and communicate changes
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings, drive improvements

## Process Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes center on clarity, structure, and iterative delivery, providing a clear framework from project initiation to release and continuous improvement. All projects begin with a rigorous initiation phase, where the business need, success metrics, stakeholders, risks, and resource requirements are captured in a Project One-pager. Only after explicit stakeholder alignment and prioritization does a project move into planning, where work is broken down into actionable backlogs, dependencies are identified, and milestones are mapped out. The planning phase emphasizes cross-functional kickoff meetings, estimation exercises, and the documentation of a Definition of Done (DoD) to ensure all stakeholders share a common understanding of deliverables.

The core roles in OctoAcme projects include the Project Manager (PM), Product Manager (PdM), Developers, QA/Testing, and Stakeholders, each with clearly defined responsibilities. The PM coordinates delivery, manages risks, and facilitates communication, while the PdM defines outcomes and prioritizes the product backlog. Developers are responsible for building, testing, and delivering features according to acceptance criteria, supported by QA specialists who validate quality before releases. Stakeholders provide input, approvals, and feedback, ensuring that project direction remains aligned with organizational goals.

Communication is systematic and frequent, with daily standups focusing on progress and blockers, weekly syncs for stakeholder alignment, and regular demos or reviews at key milestones. Reporting mechanisms include consistent status updates, the use of project management boards, risk registers, and dashboards tracking key success metrics. Risk management receives special attention, with risks continuously identified, assessed, and tracked in a dedicated register, and clear escalation paths established to ensure rapid response to challenges.

Throughout project execution, quality assurance is embedded as a continuous practice. The workflow mandates automated tests, CI linting, unit and integration tests for new logic, and manual QA for feature acceptance. Pre-release checklists, deployment protocols, and incident response playbooks help reduce release risk and improve observability. After each sprint or major milestone, the team conducts retrospectives to capture lessons learned and translate them into actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. This holistic approach ensures that OctoAcme delivers value reliably, transparently, and in alignment with both business objectives and customer needs.
